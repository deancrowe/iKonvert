iKonvert NMEA2000 Gateway SDK

Welcome to our iKonvert Developer's Guide (SDK) on GitHub. This guide is intended to help developers quickly get to grips with our iKonvert NMEA2000 Gateway and implement it with their Desktop applications or embedded hardware designs. 

The iKonvert NMEA2000 Gateway is designed to allow an Application Developer or Equipment Manufacturer to support bi-directional communication with an NMEA2000 network, through simple serial messages. Any individual or company that wishes to integrate iKonvert will need as a minimum the NMEA2000 Appendix A+B which is available from [http://nmea.org](http://nmea.org) for both NMEA members and non-members.

No special libraries are required to integrate iKonvert and the USB version uses an FTDI chipset that has good driver support for all common operating systems.
